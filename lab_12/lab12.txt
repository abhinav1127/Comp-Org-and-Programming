Lab 12

For this lab, you will have to iterate over items in an array (located at memory location 0x6000) and either add or subtract them, depending on their index (numbers at even indices will be added, and numbers at odd indices will be subtracted). Therefore, the element at index 0 will be added, the element at index 1 will be subtracted, the element at index 2 will be added, etc until you reach the end of the array, Once you have the result, save it at the memory location given by the label RESULT.

Ex: array: [47, 36, 25, 9, 14, 11, 42] will result in 
+47 - 36 + 25 - 9 + 14 - 11 + 42 = 72


Pseudocode:
addsubtract(int arr[], int length) {
	int currentState = 0; // 0 for add, 1 for subtract
	int result = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
		int element = arr[i];
		if (currentState) {
			result = result - element;
			currentState = 0;
		} else {
			result = result + element;
			currentState = 1;
		}
	}
	return result;
}
